# Homework 2

This homework will help me understand how to retrieve and display data with user feedback using https://www.weatherapi.com/

NOTE: I have put api.js in my .gitignore. This is due to the fact that my API key is within that file. The file only contains my API key, as well as the URL for the api. All of the other functions will be performed within model.js and app.js.
